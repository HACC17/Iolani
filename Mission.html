						<h2>Hawaii's Food Sustainability Defined</h2>
						<p>Hawaii's Increased Food Security and Food Self-Sufficiency Strategy</p>
					</header>

					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="Nice_Hawaii.jpg"></a>
					<p>The “Increased Food Security and Food Self-Sufficiency Strategy” sets forth objectives, policies and
							actions to increase the amount of locally grown food consumed by Hawaii’s residents. The economic
							impact of food import replacement is significant. Replacing just 10% of the food Hawaii currently
							imports would amount to approximately $313 million dollars which would remain in the State. The
							Strategy recommends actions to market “Buy Local/It Matters” and to brand and label local food
							products. The Strategy emphasizes increasing production by strengthening agricultural infrastructure
							i.e. agricultural parks, irrigation systems and distribution systems/facilities. It also recommends actions
							to provide for food safety, pest prevention and control, workforce training, research and extension
							services; and policy and organizational support. A critical factor towards successful implementation will
							be building partnerships with the increasing number of organizations involved in food selfsufficiency/food
							security. </p>
